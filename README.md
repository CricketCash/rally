# Rally

[Rally](https://material.io/design/material-studies/rally.html) is a personal finance app that uses Material Design components and Material Theming to create an on-brand experience with a data-driven aesthetic.

Rally is a part of Google's Material Studies. It is originally a design case study and no codes.

So, we tried to implement the app for Android. We craft it looks like design as close as possible and customize a lot of UI components and use [Material Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) for theming. <br/> <br/>



Here are some highlights:

![Tabs](https://github.com/hashlin/rally/blob/master/highlights/hl-tab.mp4)

Such kind of tab is not default on Android. We made it possible by using Constraint Layout's Flow.



![Graph](https://github.com/hashlin/rally/blob/master/highlights/hl-graph.mp4)

Meaningful motions and neat animations make the graph unique. Handcrafted the component on canvas.


![Pie](https://github.com/hashlin/rally/blob/master/highlights/hl-pie.mp4)

Draw the pie chart on canvas and make animation exactly the same with original.



![Tablet UI](https://github.com/hashlin/rally/blob/master/highlights/hl-tablet.mp4)

Made Rally unique on tablet, too.
